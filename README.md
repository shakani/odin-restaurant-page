Fuhgettaboutit is a fictitious deli with an eclectic assortment of sandwiches on its menu. This website was inspired by [The Odin Project's Restaurant Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) assignment. 

The entire page is one HTML document. The home, menu, and contact pages are rendered using DOM manipulation in vanilla JavaScript. Each page was written in its own module, and the entire project was bundled using Webpack. All styling is done in vanilla CSS.
